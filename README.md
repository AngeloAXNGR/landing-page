# landing-page

This is the final part of the CSS section in the Foundation Course of The Odin Project.

My task is to create a basic landing page by making use of CSS concepts I've learned so far. By the end of this task, I am expected to become comfortable in applying basic CSS concepts such as the Box Model as well as Flex in order to create layouts for webpages in the upcoming future.
